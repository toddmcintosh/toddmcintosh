**Senior Full-stack Engineer** with 10+ years of experience.

I love building products that solve interesting problems and deliver value to all stakeholders.


## My recent stack focus has been:
- Laravel, GraphQL, Apollo, PostgreSQL, React, Next.js, Prisma, Planetscale, Docker


## What I'm working on
Currently I'm contributing to a number of companies through contract development work. 

The product domains for these current projects include:
- ERP system for large North American company that resells/consigns Industrial Equipment/Machinery for global customers
- Learning Management Systems
- App rewrite from monolithic ASP.NET 4 (Web Forms) to serverless React/Next.js
- Industrial Inventory Management + eCommerce platforms 
- Startup Staff Management app for the Food Services industry.

## Dev Tools
- currently getting comfortable in Neovim (via LazyVim framework), and am loving it
- vsCode (learned vim motions in here before transitioning to Neovim)
- legacy .net work in visual studio
- postman for api testing (I know there are cli tools, but this keeps all my projects organized)
- docker for project separation
- ci/cd with github actions, but need to learn jenkins soon
- currently learning go, it's an interesting compromise between dynamically typed single threaded javascript and other more robust multithreaded languages like java and c#.
